<div class="achive" title=" My Achievements">
	Well, personally for me my biggest achievement is cracking JEE ADVANCED and getting admitted in one of the most esteemed institutions of my country-<mark>IIT Kharagpur.</mark>
	I have also performed well in my 10th as well as 12th boards by securing a 95+ % in both the exams.
	Alongwith academics, i am very keen on drawing and have won a few district level drawing competitions as well.
	I have also been awarded for my social work, for collecting funds for old age homes and children orphanages.
	I have successfully completed a course in dramatics and have won many awards for public speaking in events like MUNs, JAMs and debates. 
    I look forward to more achievements and success in my future.
